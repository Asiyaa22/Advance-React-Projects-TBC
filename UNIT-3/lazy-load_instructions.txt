📘 Project Name: React Performance Optimization Suite (Memoization, Code Splitting, and Virtualization)

🔗 Local Frontend (Project 1): http://localhost:5173

🎯 Objective

Build optimized React application demonstrating advanced performance techniques using memoization, lazy loading, code splitting, and list virtualization.
These project showcase how to build scalable React UIs that remain fast and responsive even with thousands of components rendered.

🧠 Concepts Covered (Unit 3: Performance Optimization)

▫ React.memo for component memoization
▫ useMemo and useCallback for computational and functional memoization
▫ Code Splitting using dynamic import()
▫ Lazy loading with React.lazy and Suspense
▫ List virtualization with react-window
▫ Efficient rendering and re-render prevention
▫ Suspense-based fallback UI design
▫ Dynamic component imports for performance

🧱 Technologies Used

React 18+

Vite (for ultra-fast bundling)

JavaScript (ES6+)

HTML5 + CSS3

Node.js / npm for dependency management


Execution Steps

# Clone or create project
cd react-performance-memo-lazy

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev

🛡️ Performance Notes

React.memo only works on pure components (no side effects in render).

useCallback ensures stable function references when passed as props.

useMemo should be used for heavy computations, not every derived value.

React.lazy and Suspense improve initial load time by loading code in chunks.

Avoid inline functions/objects in props to maximize memoization benefits.

📌 Outcome:
By completing these projects, you’ll gain hands-on experience in real-world performance optimization using Vite + React — covering both UI rendering and bundle optimization techniques that scale to enterprise-level apps.
