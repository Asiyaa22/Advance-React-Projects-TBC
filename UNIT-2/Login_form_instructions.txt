Project Name: Login Form Testing with React Testing Library (RTL)

🔗 Local Frontend: http://localhost:5173

🎯 Objective:

Build and test a React login form component using React Testing Library (RTL) and Vitest, focusing on testing user interactions, validation, and asynchronous behavior.
This project demonstrates unit and integration testing practices that ensure component reliability, usability, and maintainability.

🧠 Concepts Covered (Unit 2):

▫ Introduction to React Testing Library (RTL)
▫ Writing basic and advanced component tests
▫ Testing user interactions and form validation
▫ Mocking API calls and async components
▫ Writing meaningful and maintainable test cases
▫ Test setup using Vitest and JSDOM environment
▫ Snapshot and accessibility testing

🛠️ Features Implemented:

▫ Login form with email and password fields
▫ Inline validation for empty inputs
▫ Submit button triggers mock authentication logic
▫ Error message shown for invalid credentials
▫ Success message on valid input submission
▫ Comprehensive test suite using React Testing Library
▫ Mocking API responses using vi.fn()
▫ Tests simulate real user behavior with userEvent
▫ Setup file for global test configuration

📦 Concepts Breakdown:

🔹 React Testing Library (RTL):
Used to render components and test behavior based on how users interact (not internal implementation).

🔹 Vitest:
Lightweight test runner and assertion library integrated with Vite.

🔹 setupTests.js:
Registers global utilities like @testing-library/jest-dom for cleaner assertions.

🔹 User Interaction Testing:
Uses userEvent.type() and userEvent.click() to simulate typing and clicking.

🔹 Mocking Async Calls:
Fake login API simulated using vi.fn() to test success and failure scenarios.

🔹 Maintainable Test Design:
Test cases written in BDD-style (describe, it, expect) for readability and modularity.

✅ Test Scenarios Covered:

✔ Component renders with all fields and button
✔ Shows validation errors when inputs are empty
✔ Accepts valid user input and submits form
✔ Displays loading state or success message after mock API call
✔ Displays error message for invalid credentials
✔ Snapshot test to ensure UI consistency

📌 Run Instructions:
npm i
npm run test


🧪 Testing Environment Setup

Uses jsdom as a simulated browser environment.

setupTests.js imports @testing-library/jest-dom for matchers like:

toBeInTheDocument()

toHaveTextContent()

toBeDisabled()

🛡️ Notes:

• Project is frontend-only, no backend integration needed.
• Focuses entirely on component-level testing and mocking.
• Ensures that UI logic behaves correctly under real-world interactions.
• Helps build confidence before backend integration.

💡 Enhancement Ideas:

▫ Integrate mock service worker (MSW) for advanced API mocking
▫ Add password visibility toggle and test it
▫ Include accessibility (a11y) tests with axe-core
▫ Test keyboard navigation and focus order

🚀 Conclusion:
The Login Form Testing App showcases a complete React Testing Library workflow — from rendering and interaction testing to mocking asynchronous logic.
It’s an essential foundation for writing robust, maintainable, and production-grade React components.
